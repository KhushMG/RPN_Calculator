# Reverse Polish Notation 
<p>Reverse Polish Notation, also known as Postfix Notation, is when the operator (such as +, -, รท, or ร) is placed after the operands (the numbers) in a mathematical expression. <br></p> 
For example, we may look at the same mathematical expression represented in Polish Notation and Reverse Polish Notation. <br>
<strong>Polish Notation:</strong> 3 + 5 <br>
<strong>Reverse Polish Notation:</strong> 3 5 + <br>
Reverse Polish Notation places the operator (in this case the + sign) after the operands (the numbers 3 and 5)
<br>Both of these expressions will still result in 8. <br>
